# HelixML-Worker
Helix.ml / tryhelix.ai CloudFlare Worker Starter Code  
### What is this?
This CloudFlare Worker example allows you to access, via API, a fine-tuned Mistral7B model that was created using Helix's guided training platform.  Helix makes fine-tuning simple and easy even for folks with no ML background or previous knowledge.  
### How is this different than other GPT chat tools?  
Helix allows you to simply and easily integrate your own training data into a model.  This can be very powerful for creating ML solutions that run on specific, even proprietary data that online models don't (and should not) have access to.  
### How do I use this?
1. Create a free CloudFlare account if you do not already have one [CloudFlare](https://cloudflare.com)  
2. Create a Helix account at [tryhelix.ai](https://tryhelix.ai)  
3. In the Helix console, ensure "TEXT" is selected and flick the top slider to "Fine tune."
4. Here you can feed Helix a publicly-accessible web URL or plaintext or a PDF document for training.
   - Please ensure the data you submit is not covered under a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement!
   - If you have questions or concerns, I recommend reaching out to the Helix.ml team for further guidance.
   - (Note: I'm not a lawyer, so seek council before deciding to process sensitive data)
6. At this stage it's helpful to understand a little about training a model so you can dial in your training data by selecting, "Manually review training data before fine-tuning."
